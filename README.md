# Genetic Algorithms to compute exact invariant states

A long time ago, I tried to use Newton-Raphson method with matrix inversion to solve for exact invariant states in grooved channel flows. This ended up being very expensive. Let me see if I can try out a bunch of genetic algorithms to make it work.
